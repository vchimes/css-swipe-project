## Swipe Project - TailwindCSS Edition

This is the final project for _The HTML & CSS Bootcamp Edition_ by Colt Steele hosted by Udemy.

Instead of using vanilla CSS and following the course exactly, I instead chose to use TailwindCSS for this project. The codebase is currently pretty messy, with every element in the HTML. This was done intentionally as a learning experience.

The goal will be to reorganize the code to use React Components.
